# url shortrnr

## yes the name is intentional, no im not fixing it.

just a url shortener, read this for setting it up
ok so simple, basicaly make a _config.json_ file on the root and in it put this

```
{
    "dburl" : "your-mongodb-url"
}
```

you have to setup a mongodb database yourself, google how to setup one on atlas cuz thats how i have it >.<
anyways then just run **npm start** and it should run, obviously please install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) first.
latest version works fine tbh
